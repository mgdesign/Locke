Locke
======

Locke is a basic documentation repository based on the standard Raneto distribution.  
At the time of writing Raneto is at version 0.9.0 and is in the middle of the process of becoming an npm package. The main repository needed polishing and the base distribution has some hardcoded stuff that makes a bit difficult to customize themes and cconfiguration.

Still it is a killer application to write, maintain and deploy a knowledge base with ease.
